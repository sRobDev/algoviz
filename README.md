## AlgoViz

This is an algorithm visualization tool built in pure React, with no outside dependcies.  It is a tool that strives not to only show, but to teach.

Very much a work in progress.

## Using AlgoViz

Simply run `npm start` and you're off!

## Current Functionality

Add columns to the "unsorted" side of the app by using the `Add Column` button.  You can then add blocks to each column by hitting the `+` sign under each column, or remove blocks by hitting the `-` sign under each column.  From there, just choose a sorting algorithm (currently only Bubble Sort) and the results will be shown in the right side of the app.  Under the sorted results, you can navigate through the history to see each step that the algorithm took.

## Future Functionality
 - Better visualization for the algorithm steps
 - Dropdown with multiple algorithm selections 
 - Easier/more efficient column building (such as removing specific columns instead of the most recent)
 - Large dataset tab with a much bigger, randomized dataset
